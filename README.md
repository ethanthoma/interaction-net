# Interaction Nets in Odin

This is a simply hobby project to learn Odinlang and interaction nets.

The grammar is based on [HVM](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM) and their 
[paper](https://higherorderco.com/)

## Running

If you use nix, you can simply run

```
nix run github:ethanthoma/interaction-net -- <filename>
```

You can look in [examples](./examples/) or read the [grammar](./grammar.ebnf) 
and make your own.
